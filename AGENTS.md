# 8gent Jr - Agent Context

**Repo:** 8gi-foundation/8gentjr
**Domain:** 8gentjr.com
**Purpose:** AI OS for neurodivergent children. Free. COPPA compliant.

## Repo-Specific Rules

- COPPA compliance is non-negotiable. All features for users under 13 require parental consent flow.
- VPC step 2 enforced: 24h delay before COPPA email-plus verification activates.
- CI lint blocks any import of emotion/affect detection libraries (EU AI Act compliance).
- No self-injurious behavior details about Nicholas in any content. Hard guardrail.
- No formal diagnosis claims. James is self-identified AuDHD, not formally diagnosed.
- Free forever tier must remain free. No paywalls on core functionality.
- Accessibility is the primary design constraint, not aesthetics.

## Compliance Status

| Regulation | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| COPPA | Compliant (VPC step 2 merged 2026-04-30) |
| EU AI Act (emotion detection) | Compliant (CI guard merged 2026-04-30) |
| GDPR | In progress |

## Mission

Democratize infinite general intelligence for everyone. Free, local-first, privacy-preserving.

## The 8 Principles

1. Design first, not last. Friction is the enemy.
2. Free and local by default. No API keys to start. Cloud is opt-in.
3. Self-evolving. Skills accumulate. Lessons persist.
4. Hyper-personal. Learn the user's patterns, preferences, codebase, style.
5. Accessible. Voice input, screen readers, audio docs. Adapt to the user.
6. Orchestrate by default. Delegate to sub-agents. Decompose complexity.
7. Reduce friction, increase truth. Prefer voice and conversation over forms.
8. The work speaks for itself. Ship, don't sell. Evidence, not enthusiasm.

## Architecture Decisions (binding across all repos)

### Infrastructure
- **Primary cloud**: Vercel (Next.js hosting) + Hetzner cax21 (self-hosted daemon/vessels)
- **Database**: Convex (multi-tenant via `tenantId` field on every table)
- **Auth**: Clerk (prod + dev)
- **Billing**: Stripe
- **Storage**: Hetzner Object Storage
- **Vessel runtime**: Fly.io Amsterdam (eight-vessel.fly.dev) - parallel to Hetzner, not replaced yet

### 8gent OS Tenant Model
- Each user gets `{username}.8gentos.com`
- Wildcard Vercel domain routes to Next.js `[username]` dynamic route
- Convex row-level multi-tenancy via `tenantId`
- Per-user: mini-apps, marketplace installs, skills, memory, voice

### Provider Stack (8gent Code)
- Adaptive router, NOT a single provider
- Default active: `8gent` (localhost) + `ollama`
- 11 providers wired: `8gent`, `ollama`, `openrouter`, `groq`, `grok`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `mistral`, `together`, `fireworks`, `replicate`
- Failover: local 8gent -> local Qwen -> OpenRouter `:free`
- Apple Foundation: auto-enables on macOS 26 + Apple Silicon

---

## Hard Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE - all repos, all agents)

### Code
- No em dashes anywhere. Use hyphens or rewrite.
- No purple/pink/violet (hues 270-350) in any UI.
- No secrets in chat or commits. File-based injection only.
- No AI vendor names in any surface (no Claude, Anthropic, OpenAI, Hermes, Nous).
- No Co-Authored-By in git commits. James owns 100% of all work.
- No direct push to main. Always feature branch + PR.
- Post-push Vercel check mandatory: HTTP 200 + screenshot + Telegram. This is the definition of done.
- Bun, not Node, for all 8GI runtimes.
- Test before pushing. Never push untested code.

### Content / Copy
- No customer-facing AI/tooling language. No "Export for AI", "Send to Claude", etc.
- No em dashes in any publication.
- No invented biography or statistics about James.
- No self-harm details about Nicholas in any public content.
- No formal diagnosis claims (James is self-identified AuDHD, not formally diagnosed).
- aidhd.dev is stealth mode - do not mention publicly.

### Process
- Every change gets a GitHub issue first. Link PR to issue with `Closes #N`.
- All work tracked at: https://github.com/orgs/8gi-foundation/projects/1
- Multi-step setups: finish every step in order, do not jump ahead.
- Input needed from James: send as Telegram KittenTTS voice note (KittenTTS only, NO ElevenLabs ever).
- Blog posts ship with KittenTTS voiceover embedded.

## GitHub Workflow

1. Check for existing issues before starting: `gh issue list --repo 8gi-foundation/{repo}`
2. Every PR references the issue it closes: `Closes #N` in PR body.
3. Move project items: Todo -> In Progress when starting, -> Done when merged.
4. Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`. Never push directly to main.
5. PR process: branch -> commit -> push -> open PR -> merge via `gh pr merge --admin`.
6. Close issues with evidence: commit hash + PR number + validation URL.
7. Project board: https://github.com/orgs/8gi-foundation/projects/1

## Agent Mail

Async messaging across sessions and agents.
- Store: `~/.claude/agent-mail.db`
- CLI: `~/.claude/bin/agent-mail`
- Check inbox: `~/.claude/bin/agent-mail inbox --as AIJames`
- Send: `~/.claude/bin/agent-mail send --from AIJames --to {Name} --subject "..." --body "..."`
- Recipients: officer first names (Rishi, Samantha, Moira, Karen, Luis, Zara, Solomon) or codes (8TO, etc)

## Context Sync

This file is the source of truth. The CI sync workflow (`8gi-governance/.github/workflows/sync-context.yml`) propagates it to all repos on every push to `8gi-governance` main.

Per-product roadmaps: `8gi-governance/context/roadmaps/{product}.md` (maintained by Rishi / 8TO)
Current status: auto-generated by CI from GitHub API on every push to any 8GI repo main.

## 8gent OS (8gentos.com)
